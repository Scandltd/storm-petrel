.NET abstractions of the [Scand.StormPetrel.Generator](../generator/README.md). They can be implemented in projects such as [Scand.StormPetrel.FileSnapshotInfrastructure](../file-snapshot-infrastructure/README.md) or in custom libraries/test projects.

## Getting Started
To create NuGet package or .NET project with abstractions custom implementation:
* Reference [Scand.StormPetrel.Generator.Abstraction](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scand.StormPetrel.Generator.Abstraction) NuGet package in .NET project.
* Implement any or all of Scand.StormPetrel.Generator.Abstraction interfaces in the project.
